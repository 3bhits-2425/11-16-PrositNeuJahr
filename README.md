Game Description

The game features a festive Christmas scene with a custom-built Christmas tree surrounded by presents underneath. From these presents, fireworks shoot up into the sky, adding a magical touch to the atmosphere.
In the background, you can see Santa Claus with his loyal reindeer pulling a sled filled with gifts, ready give them to the children.
In the foreground, a creepy snowman disrupts the peaceful setting. His goal is to destroy the presents on the ground. Each time he destroys a present, a firework is launched into the air and explodes beautifully in the sky.
The camera dynamicaly follows the launched rocket to see the explosion before returning to its original position after a set time, allowing the player to continue, so the can destroy more presents.

Current Progress:

    Background: The Christmas scene with Santa Claus, reindeer, and the gift-filled sled is complete.
    Snowman Movement: The creepy snowman can move freely around the scene.
    Presents: Presents are placed on the ground, and upon collision with the snowman, they are destroyed, triggering a firework.

The main Goal of this project is to get the feeling of making a game and to know how to fix issues which come across. 
The hard part of this project is to get the camera to follow the rocket when the snowman collides with the present.
